# Shredder

In 2011, DARPA had a [prize
competition](http://archive.darpa.mil/shredderchallenge/) (with more
information and spoiler [
here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Shredder_Challenge_2011)) to
reassemble shredded documents from a series of 5 scanned puzzles, each with
increasing complexity.  The challenge ran for 38 days, with the winner
completing it in 33 days to claim the $50,000 prize two days later.

This documents an effort to take part in the reconstruction challenge assuming
the same time constraints of the original competition. The plan of the project
is to measure what it takes to complete the challenge, using a number of
metrics including time and cost.

Technology advancements in the time since the competition should help make
this easier.
