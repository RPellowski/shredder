# Progress log

## Week 1 Retrospective

### The good

* Completed a sprint with a good backlog and some coding done
* Have a strategy
    * what is the ideal (whole sheet of notepad paper with writing)
    * what is the the cost function to get to the ideal
    * how can we use the cost function to drive the solution based on iterating measurements and algorithms

### The bad

* Didn't complete as many stories or spend as much time as I would have liked
* Definition of done does not include CI/CD
* Worried about shortcomings of current approach- how to keep it polynomial, especially for larger puzzles
* One week out of 7 down with no puzzles solved and no reports

### Both good and bad

* Value is long term (logging and reporting only) instead of immediate (doing something with data)
* Committed to tools which would normally deserve some research into alternatives
    * Sprint tool ([https://www.pivotaltracker.com](PivotalTracker)) is different than what I am used to
    * Language (Python, because it supports PIL for imaging and NumPy/SciPy)
    * GitHub, which does not have built-in CI/CD
